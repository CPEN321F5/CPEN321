UI optimization


PostActivity: Add pictures - Yitong (in process)
Searched menu list: Display search result with title and pic rather than id (Yitong)
Item Page: UI optimization (constant text should be defined in xml rather than activity)
Chat bug: eg. Zhangsan posts an item, but Zhangsan can still chat with the seller who is himself.
Item Page: displays pictures (Yitong's new version on PostActivity will include pictures info in Json)
Item and Bid bug: Need to overwrite the onback process button (corresponding to refresh the page)
A loading page while fetching data from backend - Yitong
Item Page: add a like button
Profile page: a like list
Profile page: browsing history (can be stored in disk rather than in backend) -> (send to backend after equit the program) - Yitong
MainUI: machine learning for recommendation. - Yitong
Profile page - itemList: EXPIRED item list (add a function to repost the item)

Backend:
